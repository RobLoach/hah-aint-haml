HAH Ain't Haml (but it's close) is a PHP parser and renderer for a template / domain specific language similar to HAML. It was heavily inspired by HAML. I liked the general concept but wanted to take it a little further by minimizing the number of language constructs you needed to know as well as make it easier to use in a PHP environment. HAH is concerned with readability and reducing the amount of time and energy required to produce PHP templates.
